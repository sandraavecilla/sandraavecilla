## Hi there! ðŸ˜¸
My name is Sandra, nice to meet you!

I'm a 2D artist but I'm learning to become a front end developer. <img src="mona-whisper.gif" width="35"/>

## About me ðŸ’­
I studied Fine Arts because I've always loved drawing and painting. I also love reading everyday, watching movies or series and playing video games.

## What am I doing now? ðŸŒ±
I'm currently learning to code because I've just discovered how fun it is, and I think I'll be good at it. I've always been told that coding is like learning a new language and that's always been one of my strengths! I'm exploring this new path with the goal of working as a front-end developer someday.
